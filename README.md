Please follow both [Rutgers University's Principles of Academic Integrity](http://academicintegrity.rutgers.edu) and the [Rutgers Department of Computer Science's Academic Integrity Policy](https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/academics/undergraduate/academic-integrity-policy)

## PA1 C Programming
#### yell: String operations
Write a program yell that prints its argument all-caps. yell will read its first argument and print
it to standard output, replacing all lower-case characters with their corresponding upper-case letter.
#### rle: String operations II
Write a program rle that uses a simple method to compress strings. rle takes a single argument
and looks for repeated characters.
#### balance: Strings and Stacks
Write a program balance that checks whether a string contains correctly nested and balanced
parentheses, brackets, and braces.
#### list: Linked Lists
Write a program list that maintains and manipulates a sorted linked list according to instructions received from standard input.
#### mexp: Matrix Manipulation
Write a program mexp that multiplies a square matrix by itself a specified number of times.
#### bst: Binary Search Trees
Write a program bst that manipulates binary search trees by inserting, searching, and printing.

## PA2 One-shot learning
Write a program that performs a simple machine-learning algorithm to estimate home prices, based on several features, which will require file I/O, dynamic memory allocation, and correctly implementing a moderately complex algorithm.

## PA3 Defusing a binary bomb
Assignment is to defuse the binary bomb.

## PA4 Digital Logic
This assignment is to work more with circuits and digital logic. Write a program that reads a circuit specification and generates a truth
table for that circuit. 

## PA5 Cache Simulation
Simulator will simulate two memory operations: reading and writing individual bytes.
Program will have to read a trace file describing addresses to read or write from, and will keep track of
which blocks are stored in which cache lines in order to determine when these memory operations
result in actual reads and writes to memory.
